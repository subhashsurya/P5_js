So this is about how to visualilase the fourier series
What is basically fourier Series 
It is a series of wave patterns that when summed up toghether approximate some other function.
(smater everday) 
better explained guy.
Idea of the fourier series
A sine wave.
it has frequancy:- How often does it repeat How many cycles per unit of the time
it has amplitude:- Height of the sin wave How much diffrence between the very top and very bottom. 
idea is that some of the waveform's are created by summing up the 2 or more wave form to can we pull out the orignal wave form.
The orignal samples that make it up the frequancy and the amplitude
for example lets say you made a juice and give it to your friends and ask them figure out what are the ingredient.
